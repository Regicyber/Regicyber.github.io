                    <p>Since the time Uber plunged into the idea of ride-sharing, we can now see a boom of the ride-sharing apps around the corner. They are pretty much loved and embraced by today's generation. The major reason being, they cut down the fare structures and provide the company while travelling alone plus more or less it saves the fuel consumption as well. Altogether the above reasons form the major backbone of a ride-sharing app. It perfectly leverages all the diverse riding requirements of today's users so as to make travelling pretty much interesting and easier. Nowadays, ride-sharing is quite a common concept in all the existing taxi mobile apps.</p>

                    <p>CSAs generally focus on the production of high quality foods for a local community, often using organic or bio-dynamic farming methods, and a shared risk membership–marketing structure. This kind of farming operates with a much greater degree of involvement of consumers and other stakeholders than usual — resulting in a stronger consumer-producer relationship. The core design includes developing a cohesive consumer group that is willing to fund a whole season's budget in order to get quality foods. The system has many variations on how the farm budget is supported by the consumers and how the producers then deliver the foods. CSA theory purports that the more a farm embraces whole-farm, whole-budget support, the more it can focus on quality and reduce the risk of food waste. </p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: justify;border-style: dashed;border-color: var(--bs-yellow);">Community-supported agriculture farms today share three common characteristics: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>An emphasis on community and local produce.</li>
                        <li>Shares or subscriptions sold prior to season.</li>
                        <li>Weekly deliveries to members/subscribers.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Though CSA operation varies from farm to farm and has evolved over time, these three characteristics have remained constant. The functioning of a CSA also relies on four practical arrangements: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>For farmers to know the needs of a community.</li>
                        <li>For consumers to have the opportunity to express to farmers what their needs and financial limitations are.<br></li>
                        <li>For commitments between farmers and consumers to be consciously established.</li>
                        <li>For farmers needs to be recognized.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;font-weight: bold;border-style: dashed;border-color: var(--bs-yellow);">From this base, four main types of CSAs have been developed namely: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Farmer managed: A farmer sets up and maintains a CSA, recruits subscribers, and controls management of the CSA.</li>
                        <li>Shareholder/subscriber: Local residents set up a CSA and hire a farmer to grow crops, and shareholders/subscribers control most management.<br></li>
                        <li>Farmer cooperative: Multiple farmers develop a CSA program.</li>
                        <li>Farmer-shareholder cooperative: Farmers and local residents set up and cooperatively manage a CSA.</li>
                    </ol>

                            <p class="mb-0">In most original CSAs, a core group of members existed. This core group of members helped to make decisions about and run the CSA including marketing, distribution, administrative, and community organization functions. CSAs with a core group of members are most profitable and successful. CSAs with a core group of members operate more successfully as farmer-shareholder cooperatives while those without core members rely much more on subscriptions and run most prominently as shareholder/subscriber CSAs</p>

                    <p>Community-supported agriculture in America was influenced by the ideas of Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian philosopher. He developed the concepts of anthroposophy and bio-dynamic agriculture. The Temple-Wilton Community Farm used his ideas to develop three main goals of CSAs:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>New forms of property ownership: the idea that land should be held in common by a community through a legal trust, which leases the land to farmers</li>
                        <li>New forms of cooperation: the idea that a network of human relationships should replace the traditional system of employers and employees<br></li>
                        <li>New forms of economy: that the economy should not be based on increasing profit, but should be based on the actual needs of the people and land involved in an enterprise</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4 class="section-heading" style="font-size: 32px;text-align: center;">Sharing the meal/Distribution</h4>
                    <p>Shares are distributed in several different ways. Shares are most often distributed weekly. Most CSAs allow share pick up at the farm. Shares are also distributed through regional drop-off, direct home or office drop-off, farmers' markets, and community center/church drop-off. For example, the new "Farmie Markets" of upstate New York take orders online and have a number of farmers who send that week's orders to a central point in a limited region, for distribution by the organizers. </p><a href="#"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/images%20(2).jpeg"></a><span class="text-muted caption">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.<br>pictures sourced from : www.fix.com</span>
